👋 Hi, I’m Everett Flynn. I'm a teenage coder (at the time of writing) who has put hands in many different things. I am currently enrolled at a community college and right now I'm going for a major in Software Engineering Technology. My dream has always been to run my own Big Tech company, but if that doesn't work out, I'll be prepared to work for another company.

I have created...
- 🕹️ Video games
- 🪵 Minecraft plugins for Spigot
- 🗔 Websites
- 🐍 Python scripts
- ...many more things

I guess I'm a Jack of all trades, master of none.
