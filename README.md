ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Everett Flynn. I'm a teenage developer who has put hands in many different things. I graduated high school as valedictorian in 2024 with my Associate's Degree in Software Engineering Technology. I love programming as a whole, but I especially love web development. In my free time, I make random web apps with focus on clean interfaces and functionality. My two main languages are JavaScript and Python, though I've worked in several others.

Technologies I've worked with:
* ReactJS
* Svelte (_loved it_)
* Firebase
* WebSockets
* C++ (_mostly in school_)
* Arduino
* _...and many more_
