ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Everett Flynn. I'm a teenage developer (at the time of writing) who has put hands in many different things. I am currently enrolled at a community college and right now I'm going for a major in Software Engineering Technology. My dream has always been to start my own tech company, but if that doesn't work out, I'll be prepared to work for another company.

Right now, I'm trying to make as many web products as I can (mostly in React), and I love web development as a whole. I've learned so much, but I still have much to learn...
