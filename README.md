ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Everett Flynn. I'm a teenage developer (at the time of writing) who has put hands in many different things. I graduated high school as valedictorian in 2024 with my Associate's Degree in Software Engineering Technology.

Right now, I'm trying to make as many web products as I can (mostly in React), and I love web development as a whole. I've learned so much, but I still have much to learn...
