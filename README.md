ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Everett Flynn. I'm a teenage coder (at the time of writing) who has put hands in many different things.

I have created...
- Video games
- A small operating system
- Minecraft plugins for Spigot
- Websites
- many more things

I guess I'm a Jack of all trades, master of none.

My current project is a messaging website called Strawberry made with React frontend and Python websockets backend. (the repository is private because I don't want people to steal my code, I'm not sure how all that works)
